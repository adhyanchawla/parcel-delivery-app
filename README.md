# parcel-delivery-app
1. There are certain features that are not currently implemented.
2. The implemented features are as follows:
    i. The login register functionality is done (fully implemented at both frontend and backend).
    ii. Order form created with a feature of uploading the image is done.
    iii. Endpoints to login, register and order have been defined.
3. There's a bug (tried resolving it but couldnt find a perfect way out): is when a user registers and successfully logins in, then reload the page as it will change the navigation bar buttons. I was unable to find a solution to it.
